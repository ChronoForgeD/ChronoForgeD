👋 FELLICITATIONS MALEFACTORS!!!

## 👋 Hey, I’m David (aka ChronoForge)

I’m a gameplay systems designer / programmer focused on **combat, progression, and moment-to-moment feel** in Unreal Engine 5.

My goal is to work on teams where we:
- Build systems that are **readable, fair, and expressive** for players.
- Iterate based on **playtests, data, and clear design goals**.
- Treat even small prototypes with **production-level care**.

---

### 🎯 What I’m Working On

Right now I’m building a set of small, focused prototypes that mirror real studio work:

- ⚔️ **Ability & Combat Systems**  
  Data-driven abilities with cooldowns, resources, hit reactions, and clear feedback.

- 🧠 **Systems & Progression**  
  Stats, rewards, and simple economies that support meaningful player choices.

- 📓 **Design Specs & Docs**  
  Short, practical writeups that explain the *why* behind each system, not just the *how*.

Each project is scoped intentionally small so I can:  
**design → implement → playtest → iterate**, like I would on a live team.

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5 (gameplay, Blueprints; starting C++ integration)
- **Languages:** C++ (learning), Blueprints, some C# / Python
- **Design Focus:**  
  - Combat feel (timing, responsiveness, clarity)  
  - Ability design and tuning  
  - Basic quest / event flows and reward loops  

- **Workflow:**  
  - Git for version control  
  - Feature-based branches and clear commit messages  
  - Lightweight design docs and checklists to keep scope under control

### 📂 What You’ll Find Here

- Small **gameplay labs** (abilities, quests, economies, combat prototypes)
- Experiments aimed at **technical game design** and **gameplay programming** skills
- In-progress systems built to align with **junior / internship role expectations**

Each repo includes:
- A short README explaining the **problem the system solves**
- Notes on **design tradeoffs** and **next steps** I’d take with more time
