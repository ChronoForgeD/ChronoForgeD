👋 FELLICITATIONS MALEFACTORS!!! I’m David (aka ChronoForge)

I’m a beginner game designer/programmer focused on **gameplay systems** and **combat design** in Unreal Engine 5.  
Right now I’m building a portfolio of small, polished prototypes that showcase my design, programming and iterative skills.

---

### 🎯 Current Focus

- 🧠 **Gameplay & systems programming** in **Unreal Engine 5** (Blueprints + starting C++)
- ⚔️ **Reactive combat**: abilities, cooldowns, hit reactions, and enemy behaviors
- 📊 **Data-driven design**: stats, progression, and tuning via structs/DataTables
- 🧪 **Prototyping** small, contained mechanics that feel good to play

---

### 🛠️ Tech & Tools

- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5  
- **Languages:** C++ (learning), Blueprints, a bit of C#/Python  
- **Design:** Systems design, combat loops, progression, and encounter ideas  
- **Other:** Git, basic UE UI, simple AI/state machines

### 📂 What You’ll Find Here

- Small gameplay prototypes (combat, abilities, progression systems)
- Experiments with **reactive combat** and **moment-to-moment game feel**
- Future **portfolio-ready systems** built to match industry job requirements
